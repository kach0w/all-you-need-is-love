# All You Need Is Love!
- I'm just doing an attention-based transformer neural network for an old Shakespeare dataset I found!
- This was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's blog entry on RNNs
- Future plans are to try this out with some other datasets and play with actual RNNs, LSTMs, or GRU
- If you don't get the reference read about transformers on Wikipedia or something
